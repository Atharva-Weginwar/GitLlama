GitLlama is an AI-powered tool that revolutionizes how developers interact with and understand Git repositories.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for GitLlama came from common pain points in software development:

1. Code Review Complexity: Developers often struggle to quickly understand the context and impact of changes in pull requests, especially for large commits.

2. Repository Exploration: New team members or developers returning to a project after a while find it challenging to grasp the overall structure and recent changes in a repository.

3. Knowledge Silos: Important details about code changes often remain in the heads of individual developers, making it difficult for teams to maintain a shared understanding of the project.

4. Time Consumption: Manually going through commit histories and trying to understand the evolution of a codebase is extremely time-consuming.

5. Non-Technical Stakeholder Communication: It's challenging to provide clear, concise updates about technical progress to non-technical team members or clients.

These challenges inspired us to create a tool that leverages AI to provide quick, meaningful insights into code repositories, making them more accessible and understandable to all team members.
